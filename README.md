Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my final project for triple ten bootcamp to get my final certification in business analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more towards data analytics since it involves using more data tools such as SQl which ius my personal favoreit programming language. 
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on more data driven projects using Advanced SQL and Python as I would like to move in the direction of data engineering. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with coding projects. 
- 💬 Ask me about anything data related. I love helping others when they feel stuck with data projects.

# 📊 Superstore Returns Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This project explores customer returns data from the Superstore dataset to evaluate how returns impact sales and profit. Using Tableau, I built an interactive dashboard that highlights key return metrics, root causes, and their financial implications. The project was completed as part of my Data Analytics program at TripleTen.

## Dataset
- **Source:** Superstore dataset (provided by TripleTen)  
- **Tables Used:** Orders, Returns, People  
- **Key Columns:** Order ID, Returned (Yes/No), Sales, Profit, Category, Region, Segment  

---

## Objectives
- Determine how returns should be measured: return rate, total number of returns, or total cost of returns.  
- Identify key root causes of returns across categories and regions.  
- Provide visual insights into how returns affect profitability.  

---

## Dashboard Components
The dashboard combines multiple chart types to give a complete view of customer returns:

- **Bar Chart:** Compares return rates across product categories.  
- **Line Chart:** Tracks trends in return rates over time.  
- **Scatter Plot:** Displays the relationship between profit and returns.  
- **Geographical Map:** Highlights regions with the highest return costs and frequency.  

Each chart includes tooltips and filters to allow interactive exploration of the data.  

---

## Key Insights
- Technology products show higher return rates, but they also drive strong profit margins.  
- Certain regions experience significantly higher return costs, indicating possible supply chain or quality issues.  
- Seasonal spikes in returns align with high-sales periods, such as end-of-year holidays.  

---

## Tools & Methodology
- **Tool Used:** Tableau  
- **Process:**  
  - Joined Orders and Returns tables using a left join on `Order ID`.  
  - Built calculated fields for Return Rate and Profit Impact.  
  - Designed and combined bar, line, scatter, and geographical charts into a cohesive dashboard.  

---

## Future Improvements
- Add forecasting to anticipate return rates in upcoming quarters.  
- Segment analysis by customer demographics to identify patterns.  
- Include advanced parameters for more flexible user-driven analysis.
